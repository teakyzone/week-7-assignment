# Project name: Moods


### Live Github Pages link(if applicable):


## Project description:


(e.g. A site which both allows you to create a virtual pantry of all the food items in your house and see which recipes you might want to cook using those ingredients.)

## Problem domain:

(e.g. People can't always remember what food items they have in their houses, and coming up with recipe ideas isn't always easy.)

## User stories:

(e.g. As a user, I want to see a list of the items I have in my pantry.)

## Wireframe(s):

(add an image here if you wish)

A list of any libraries, frameworks, or packages that your application requires in order to properly function:
(e.g. Express.js, pg, cors...)

### ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

### ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

-
-

### ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- Choosing an API suitable for what I wanted was difficult, I initially had the idea for the user to search via mood to return a suitable meme. (using IMG flip) After reading the rules of IMG flip I realised the user would need a membership/login. (This was after i crafted the html and java for it) (as i write this I'm thinking about another API to use)
